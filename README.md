<h1> Connor Farrell - Portfolio - MTM6201-020 </h1>
===================================================
<h2> Description </h2>
<p> This was an amazing process, I truly had a really fun time creating my portfolio. The base structure is made up from Bootstrap but then I styled it to match my mock up. I had a Wix website before I started the program so I took elements from that website and took the knowledge I learned over the past 2 semesters of design and coding and mashed it all together to create this portfolio. I wanted to keep the branding consistent across all pages so you will notice the red line border on alot of elements. I also added a fun animation I found in CodePen that I hope users will enjoy!<p>
===================================================
<h2> Road-Blocks / Problems </h2>
<p>As awesome as Bootstrap was to build the base structure of my website, it was an absolute pain to customize. After figuring out how to select the items I wanted to customize, working with Bootstrap got a lot easier. Optimizing images was also an issue at times. Sometimes the images would appear blurry (unfortunately some still do) and this is due many different factors. The fix was usually just to rearrange the photos in the grid so they could display at a proper size. I also had many issues with setting up the animation as it would target other elements on my page</p>
